> [!TIP]
> Pronounced "tweaker".

## What it does

- GitHub-style continuous diff in the terminal. Scroll through every changed file in one stream.
- PR-style comments at the line, range, file, and review level. 
- Review tracking at file or hunk granularity, persisted across sessions.
- Three export targets: push a real review to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, copy structured
  markdown to your clipboard, or pipe to stdout.
- Works with git, jj, and mercurial. Reviews uncommitted changes, commit ranges, or any GitHub PR,
  GitLab MR, or Bitbucket PR.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL tuicr.dev/install.sh | sh
# or
brew install tuicr
# or
sudo pacman -S tuicr
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods (cargo, mise, nix, binaries, source)</summary>

```bash
# Cargo
cargo install tuicr

# Mise
mise use github:agavra/tuicr

# Nix
nix run github:agavra/tuicr
```

Pre-built binaries: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agavra/tuicr/releases). Linux releases
include dynamically linked GNU and static musl variants.

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agavra/tuicr.git
cd tuicr
cargo install --path .
```

</details>

Update the active installation with one command:

```bash
tuicr update
tuicr update 0.18.0 # Install a known-good version
```

`tuicr update` uses Homebrew, Cargo, Mise, or a Nix profile when that manager owns the
executable. Install-script and manually downloaded binaries update in place from the matching
GitHub release asset after SHA-256 verification. Exact-version installs support Cargo and direct
binaries; use the package manager's pinning workflow for Homebrew, Mise, or Nix. A `nix run`
invocation is temporary rather than installed; rerun it to use the current flake, or use
`nix profile install github:agavra/tuicr` for an installation that `tuicr update` can upgrade.

## Quick start

```bash
tuicr                       # Pick from a commit selector
tuicr tui                   # Same TUI, explicit subcommand
tuicr -w                    # Uncommitted changes (skip selector)
tuicr -w --no-untracked     # Tracked uncommitted changes only (like `git diff HEAD`)
tuicr --staged              # Staged changes only (like `git diff --staged`)
tuicr -w --no-staged        # Unstaged changes only (like `git diff`)
tuicr -w main               # Working tree vs main (like `git diff main`)
tuicr -r main..HEAD         # Commit range
tuicr pr 125                # GitHub PR, or Bitbucket PR
tuicr mr 125                # GitLab MR
tuicr tui pr 125            # GitHub PR via explicit TUI subcommand
tuicr tui mr 125            # GitLab MR via explicit TUI subcommand
tuicr --stdout              # Pipe the review to stdout
tuicr review list           # List saved local review sessions
tuicr update                # Update the active installation
tuicr update 0.18.0         # Install a known-good version
```

Inside tuicr, navigate with `j`/`k`, press `c` to comment, then `y` to copy the review or
`:submit` to push it to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Existing PR discussions render inline;
pressing `c` on one replies to it — the reply posts to the forge immediately, outside the
`:submit` draft flow. `c` on one of your own comments replies to it too, threading the answer
underneath; `tuicr review reply` does the same from the CLI, which is how a coding agent
answers your review comments in place (see [docs/REVIEW_CLI.md](docs/REVIEW_CLI.md)). When reopening a pull request you've reviewed
before, tuicr preselects commits newer than your latest submitted review when that metadata is
available; commits already covered by that review are marked with `✓` in the inline selector.
(Bitbucket does not record which commit an approval covered, so that preselection does not apply
there.)
Use `:summary` during a review to show every pending local-draft comment. The summary replaces the
diff while leaving the file sidebar visible when it is open. The first
comment is selected when the view opens; use `j`/`k` to select the next or previous comment, and
the view scrolls automatically to keep it visible. Press `Enter` to jump to the selected comment
in the continuous diff, leaving single-file view if necessary, or `Esc` to return to the diff. If
its file or hunk is already marked reviewed, tuicr reveals the target without clearing that
reviewed state.
Auto-detects git, jj, or mercurial.

## How it compares

| | tuicr | [hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk) | [lumen](https://github.com/jnsahaj/lumen) | `gh pr review` | `git diff` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| TUI diff viewer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

¹ Lumen has `j`/`k` navigation but no broader vim model (visual mode, `{N}G`, `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u`,
etc.).

² `gh pr review` posts approve/comment/request-changes at the review level only. No inline line
comments.

## Export your review

When you're done reviewing, send your comments wherever the work continues.

### To GitHub

`:submit` opens a picker for Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft. Inline comments land
on the right lines as a real PR review. Review-level comments become the review summary.
Requires `gh` authenticated to the repo.

### To GitLab

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, or Request changes on a GitLab MR. Inline comments post as
discussion notes. Review-level comments become the summary. Requires `glab` authenticated to the
host. Request changes needs your account to be an assigned reviewer. Only Draft is GitHub-only
here. See [docs/GITLAB.md](docs/GITLAB.md) for setup, self-hosted instances, and troubleshooting.

### To Bitbucket

`:submit` offers Comment or Approve on a Bitbucket Cloud PR. Inline comments post as inline PR
comments, multi-line ranges included; review-level comments become general PR comments. Requires
`bkt` authenticated to `bitbucket.org`. Request changes and Draft are not supported yet, and
Bitbucket Data Center is out of scope. See [docs/BITBUCKET.md](docs/BITBUCKET.md) for setup,
required token scopes, and troubleshooting.

### To Azure DevOps

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, or Request changes on an Azure DevOps PR. Inline comments post
as PR comment threads; Approve/Request changes also cast a reviewer vote. Auth is a Personal
Access Token in `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` (preferred — works with enterprise tenants), falling back
to `az login` via the Azure CLI. Run tuicr from a local clone of the repo — Azure exposes no
unified-diff API, so the diff is built with `git diff base...head`. See
[docs/AZURE.md](docs/AZURE.md) for setup, supported URL forms, and MVP limitations.

### To your coding agent

`y` or `:clip` copies a structured markdown block to your clipboard. Each comment has a number
and a file/line anchor: 

```markdown
I reviewed your code and have the following comments. Please address them.

1. `src/auth.rs` - Consider adding unit tests
2. `src/auth.rs:42` - Magic number should be a named constant
3. `src/auth.rs:50-55` - This block could be refactored
```

Paste it back to any coding agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc).

For an agent-driven workflow where your agent opens tuicr in a cmux, tmux, Zellij, or
Herdr split pane, see [skills/tuicr/SKILL.md](skills/tuicr/SKILL.md).

### To stdout

Run with `--stdout` to pipe the markdown to another process:

```bash
tuicr --stdout > review.md
tuicr --stdout | pbcopy
```

## Review session CLI

`tuicr review` exposes saved sessions without opening the TUI. It can list
sessions, add comments, and print stored comments for agent and script
integrations. See [docs/REVIEW_CLI.md](docs/REVIEW_CLI.md).

The TUI creates a persisted session file when a review target becomes active,
so collaborative tools can add comments immediately. Empty auto-created session
files are removed when the TUI exits. `tuicr review list` marks currently open
TUI sessions with `"active": true`.

Inside the TUI, the review target selector's **Sessions** tab lists the saved
reviews for the current checkout, so you can resume one by picking it instead of
retyping the commit range it was opened with. Open it with `:sessions` or cycle
to it with `Tab`.

## Library API

tuicr also exposes a Rust library API for tools that want to build on top of its
persisted review sessions. `ReviewStore` can list sessions for a checkout, load a
session, and add review, file, line, or range comments using the same insertion
primitive as the TUI.

```rust
use tuicr::{AddCommentRequest, CommentTarget, CommentType, LineSide, ReviewStore};

let store = ReviewStore::new();
let sessions = store.list_sessions_for_repo("/path/to/repo")?;
let session = &sessions[0].session_ref;

store.add_comment(
    session,
    AddCommentRequest {
        target: CommentTarget::Line {
            path: "src/main.rs".into(),
            line: 42,
            side: LineSide::New,
        },
        content: "Handle the empty case here.".into(),
        comment_type: CommentType::from_id("issue"),
    },
)?;
```

## Configuration

Path: `~/.config/tuicr/config.toml` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\tuicr\config.toml` on Windows.

```toml
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"
diff_view = "side-by-side"   # or "unified"
ignore_whitespace = false    # ignore all whitespace in local VCS diffs
appearance = "system"        # or "dark" / "light"
mouse = true
leader = ";"                  # configurable prefix for leader shortcuts
editor = "nvim"               # editor for `e` / `:edit`; overrides $EDITOR
comment_vim = false           # vim modal editing in the review comment box
relative_line_numbers = false # show rendered-row distances in the diff gutter

[[comment_types]]
id = "issue"
color = "red"
definition = "must fix before merge"
```

Bundled themes: `dark`, `light`, `ayu-light`, `ayu-mirage`, `onedark`, `github-light`,
`github-dark`, `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`,
`catppuccin-mocha`, `everforest-dark`, `everforest-light`, `gruvbox-dark`,
`gruvbox-light`, `nord-dark`, `nord-light`, `nord-dark-high-contrast`,
`nord-light-high-contrast`, `solarized-light`, `solarized-dark`, `tokyo-night-storm`,
`tokyo-night-day`.

Local themes: set `theme = "my-theme"` or run `tuicr --theme my-theme`, then create
`~/.config/tuicr/themes/my-theme.toml` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\tuicr\themes\my-theme.toml`
on Windows. Local themes may reference a local `syntax_theme = "my-syntax.tmTheme"` file for
syntax highlighting. A ready-to-copy example lives at [`examples/tuicr-teal.toml`](examples/tuicr-teal.toml)
with its matching [`examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme`](examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme) syntax theme.

Full options, theme resolution precedence, `comment_types` semantics, and `.tuicrignore` rules in
[docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).
